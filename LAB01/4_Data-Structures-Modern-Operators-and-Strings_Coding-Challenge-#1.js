// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
// next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.

// Your tasks:

// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
const players1 = [
    'Neuer',
    'Pavard',
    'Martinez',
    'Alaba',
    'Davies',
    'Kimmich',
    'Goretzka',
    'Coman',
    'Muller',
    'Gnarby',
    'Lewandowski'
];
const players2 = [
    'Burki',
    'Schulz',
    'Hummels',
    'Akanji',
    'Hakimi',
    'Weigl',
    'Witsel',
    'Hazard',
    'Brandt',
    'Sancho',
    'Gotze'
];
// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
// players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
// goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
const gk = players1[0];
const fieldPlayers = players1.slice(1);
// console.log(fieldPlayers);
// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
const allPlayers = [...players1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);
// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
// new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
// 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
const players1Final = [...players1, 'Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'];
// 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
// 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
const game = {
    odds: {
        team1: 1.5,
        draw: 3.5,
        team2: 4.0,
    },
}

const {team1, draw, team2} = game.odds;

// 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
// names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
// number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
function printGoals(...players){
    console.log(`${players.length} goals were scored by:`);
    players.forEach(player => console.log(player));
}

printGoals('Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski')
// 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which
// team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
const moreLikelyToWin = team1 < team2 && 'Team1' || 'Team2';
console.log(`${moreLikelyToWin} is more likely to win.`)

// Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
// Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
